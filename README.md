## 1. The Problem: The Freelancer's Financial Black Hole

Modern freelancers and gig economy workers are the CEOs of their own careers, but they operate in a financial black hole. They juggle multiple income streams with no unified view of their earnings, live in constant fear of a surprise tax bill, and struggle to prove their income for major life events like getting a loan or renting an apartment. This creates a state of persistent financial anxiety, turning the freedom of freelancing into a source of stress.

## 2. The Solution: The Freelancer Financial Hub
